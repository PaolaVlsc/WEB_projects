**Description:**

This project marks the initiation of the 50-day coding challenge, featuring an engaging user interface known as "Expanding Cards." The web page consists of a container housing five distinct panels, each representing a character from the popular game Genshin Impact.

   - The HTML structure defines a container and five panels, each associated with a Genshin Impact character.
   - Metadata, including character names and background images, enriches the content.

2. **Stylesheet Integration:**

   - External stylesheets (styles.css) contribute to the visual appeal and layout of the expanding cards.

3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
   - Utilizes external JavaScript (script.js) to enable the dynamic expansion behavior upon clicking a panel.

**Objective:**

The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive and visually appealing Expanding Cards component. Each panel serves as a gateway to explore information about a specific Genshin Impact character, enhancing user engagement and interactivity.

**Outcome:**

Users are presented with a captivating interface where they can click on any character panel to reveal additional details. This project sets the tone for the 50-day challenge, demonstrating a seamless blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve an interactive and aesthetically pleasing user experience.
